## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am nearly finished with the comprehensive 6-month JS course, and I found myself forgetting very basic HTML and CSS skills. I went through HTML and CSS very quickly and never went too deep into it, so I would like to improve on that. I decided to go back to basics and make sure I get them right, therefore I picked my first most-basic challenge. I have used CSS variables for the first time.
